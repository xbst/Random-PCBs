# Random-PCBs
<br>This repo is for my PCB design projects. You can find all the files you need to order your own from a PCB manufacturer here.

## Projects

## License & Selling Your Own
These projects are licensed with [GPL v3](./LICENSE). This means you are free to make your own, modify, sell, including commercially, and do pretty much whatever you want with the designs. You have to credit the project, and you cannot claim that I endorse that sale. There are a few more details with the license too (like warranty, modifications, etc.), so check the [license](./LICENSE) file for more details. This was my summary of the license, and the actual license file contains the correct information!
